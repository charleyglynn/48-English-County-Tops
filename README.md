# 48 English County Tops

Geojson describing all 48 English Counties highest points.

I worked on a project where I needed to map all 48 County Tops in Enland - the highest point in each of the Ceremonial Counties.
I cobbled together information from various sources (including https://www.hill-bagging.co.uk/index.php).

Some of the heights were updated using Ordnance Survey data.
